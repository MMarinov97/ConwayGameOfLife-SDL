# The Game Of Life & SDL2

Implementation of [Conway's Game of Life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life) in C++ using the [SDL2](https://www.libsdl.org/) development library.
This is just a demo showing how to draw simple 2D graphics using SDL2.

It uses the first version of a simple 2D graphics engine (engine.h) that is still in development.
